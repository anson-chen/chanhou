	<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you log in to your FoodyMonkey account or use certain FoodyMonkey features. Cookies are then sent back to the originating server on each subsequent visit, or to another server that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are widely used in order to make the FoodyMonkey work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the FoodyMonkey team.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you log in efficiently, remembering certain preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have used the FoodyMonkey before or whether you are a new user.
We only serve cookies directly from us to your device. We do not serve any third party cookies.
Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your application is open. These are deleted automatically once you close the application. Other cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after the application is closed. They can be used by FoodyMonkey to recognize your device when you open and use FoodyMonkey again.
